# Low-Level System Design - Decorator Pattern

This document contains a series of questions designed to test your understanding, application, and implementation of the Decorator Pattern in system design. The questions are categorized into Conceptual, Design, Implementation, and Evaluation sections.

## Conceptual Questions

1. **Explain the Decorator Pattern.**
   - Describe the problem the Decorator Pattern solves.
   - Explain how the Decorator Pattern adheres to the Open/Closed Principle.

2. **Compare and contrast the Decorator Pattern with the inheritance approach for adding responsibilities to objects.**
   - What are the advantages of using the Decorator Pattern over inheritance?
   - Are there any scenarios where inheritance might be preferred over the Decorator Pattern?

3. **Describe a real-world scenario where the Decorator Pattern would be beneficial.**
   - Provide an example from your own experience where the Decorator Pattern helped in making the system more flexible and maintainable.

4. **What are the key components of the Decorator Pattern?**
   - Identify and describe the roles of the Component, ConcreteComponent, Decorator, and ConcreteDecorator in the pattern.

## Design Questions

1. **Design a system for a text editor that supports multiple text formats (like plain text, bold, italic, underline).**
   - Use the Decorator Pattern to design this system.
   - Provide class diagrams and explain the responsibilities of each class.

2. **Design a notification system where different types of notifications (email, SMS, push) can be decorated with additional features (logging, filtering, retry mechanism).**
   - Explain how you would use the Decorator Pattern to achieve this.
   - Provide a class diagram and pseudocode for key components.

3. **Design a graphical UI component library where base components (like buttons, text fields) can be decorated with additional features (like borders, scroll bars, shadows).**
   - How would you use the Decorator Pattern to design this system?
   - Provide a class diagram and code snippets for key components.

4. **Suppose you have a base `Pizza` class with methods to get the description and cost. Design a system where different types of toppings (cheese, pepperoni, olives) can be added to a pizza using the Decorator Pattern.**
   - Provide a class diagram and pseudocode for key components.
   - Discuss how you would handle different combinations of toppings.

## Implementation Questions

1. **Implement the Decorator Pattern in C++ for a simple coffee shop example where you have different types of coffee and condiments (like milk, mocha, soy).**
   - Provide the complete implementation code.
   - Explain each class and method in your implementation.

2. **Given a base `Shape` class in Java with a method to draw the shape, implement a decorator that adds color to the shape.**
   - Provide the complete implementation code.
   - Explain how your decorator adds color without modifying the base `Shape` class.

3. **Implement a logging system in Python where the base logger can be decorated with additional features like timestamp, log level, and file logging.**
   - Provide the complete implementation code.
   - Explain how each decorator adds a specific feature to the base logger.

4. **Design and implement a simple car rental system in Java where different car models can be decorated with additional features like GPS, baby seat, and insurance.**
   - Provide the complete implementation code.
   - Explain how the Decorator Pattern helps in adding features to different car models dynamically.

## Evaluation Questions

1. **Review a given implementation of the Decorator Pattern and identify any design flaws or improvements.**
   - Provide a sample implementation (intentionally include some flaws).
   - Ask the candidate to identify and suggest improvements.

2. **How would you test a system that uses the Decorator Pattern?**
   - Describe unit tests and integration tests for a decorator-based system.
   - Provide examples of test cases for a coffee shop example where you have different types of coffee and condiments.

3. **Discuss the performance implications of using the Decorator Pattern.**
   - How does the Decorator Pattern affect memory usage and execution time?
   - Are there any scenarios where the Decorator Pattern might introduce significant overhead?

By exploring these questions, you'll gain a deeper understanding of the Decorator Pattern and how it can be effectively used in system design to create flexible and maintainable code.
