What is AVL tree ?
AVL tree is a self-balancing Binary Search Tree (BST) where the difference between heights of 
left and right subtrees cannot be more than one for all nodes. 

Why AVL tree ?
Most of the BST operations (e.g., search, max, min, insert, delete.. etc) take O(h) time where 
h is the height of the BST. The cost of these operations may become O(n) for a skewed Binary 
tree. If we make sure that the height of the tree remains O(log(n)) after every insertion and
deletion, then we can guarantee an upper bound of O(log(n)) for all these operations. The 
height of an AVL tree is always O(log(n)) where n is the number of nodes in the tree.
